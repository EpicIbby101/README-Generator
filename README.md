# Module 11 Challenge: Professional README Generator

## README Generator
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 

This command-line application dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the 'inquirer package'

I declare that all of my work is my own.

### The user is asked for the following before the program creates a README.md

- The title of my project 
- Sections entitled:
- Description 
- Table of Contents 
- Installation 
- Usage 
- License 
- Contributing 
- Tests 
- Questions
  
## Installation
To install this command-line application:
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- npm install for dependencies
- cd into the program directory
- In your terminal 'node index.js'
